# Take-home Mini Project

## Summary:

Please implement a single-page web application that allows a user to take a test with 4 true/false questions. Only one question should be made visible to the user at a time. Results can be stored on the client; server-side code is not necessary. Examples of JSON for questions and answers have been included below. Feel free to implement as many or as few of the requirements as youâ€™d like.
